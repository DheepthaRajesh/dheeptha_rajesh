# 50.021-AI-Project-2024

## Project Description 
Over 1 million flats spanning across 24 towns and 3 estates, Singapore's public housing stands out as a distinct entity. These flats serve as the residence for over 80% of the country's resident population with 90% being homeowners. ​

The recent upswing in resale flat prices and the unpredictable trends in the market have underscored the necessity for accurate predictions of resale flat prices to facilitate well informed decisions. ​

The Housing Development Board (HDB), a government agency, oversees public housing in singapore and various elements, including location, flat size, flat type, remaining lease, and others, influence HDB resale flat prices. 

**How might we** develop an AI-driven solution to accurately predict resale flat prices in Singapore's public housing market, addressing the pressing need for accurate forecasts amidst market fluctuations?
