# ML Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - Sequence labelling model for sentiment analysis

This Machine Learning project is to build a sequence labelling model using Hidden Markov Model for training data in two different languages and then use this system to predict tag sequences for new sentences to perform sentiment analysis.

The project includes estimation of emission and transition parameters, and using viterbi algorithm to determine the k-th best output sequences for the given data.

Written using Python

Project done in Term 5 SUTD - May 2023
