## Cybersecurity Portfolio

#### Contains cybersecurity projects from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification including security audits, risk assessments, managing file permissions in Linux, SQL filtering for security investigations, vulnerability report for a database server, and incident report analysis for a DDoS attack - all based on real-world scenarios. 


**Cybersecurity Professional Statement:**

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst with a strong technical background in software development, testing, and AI/ML. My expertise includes proficiency in programming languages, database management, and a deep understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals and tools. With strong critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, I am committed to identifying and analyzing potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational assets. I have a client-focused mindset and aim to develop real-world technology solutions that enhance security and positively impact the lives of customers while safeguarding the organization and its people.

**Internal Security audit and risk assessments:**

Conducted an internal security audit and risk assessment for a fictional company, Botium Toys, using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The project involved evaluating current controls, compliance with industry standards, and providing recommendations to enhance the company's security posture and mitigate potential risks.


**File permissions management in Linux:**

Demonstrated the ability to manage file and directory permissions in a Linux environment. This project involved analyzing and modifying access control settings to ensure compliance with security policies, such as restricting unauthorized write access and managing hidden file permissions. This is a key skill in maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized access within organizations. By managing permissions effectively, organizations can enforce least-privilege principles, which is a cornerstone of cybersecurity best practices. 


**SQL Filter Queries for security incident investigation:**

Utilized SQL queries to investigate security incidents by applying advanced filtering techniques. The tasks involved retrieving records from employee and login attempt databases, specifically focusing on after-hours login failures, suspicious login dates, and login attempts outside designated regions. I also extracted employee information based on department and location, applying LIKE, AND, OR, and NOT operators for precise data filtering. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze data patterns and detect anomalies, crucial for identifying potential security threats and enhancing organizational security.


**Vulnerability Assessment Report for Database Server:**

Conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a database server critical to business operations, with a focus on identifying and evaluating potential security weaknesses in access controls in alignment with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines. The assessment highlighted risks posed by unauthorized data access, cyber threats, and potential competitor data exfiltration, along with corresponding mitigation strategies. This project demonstrates my ability to identify vulnerabilities that could impact system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and to propose actionable remediation steps to bolster overall security.


**Incident report analysis for DDoS attack:**

Analyzed a simulated cybersecurity incident involving a DDoS attack on network infrastructure, applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework phases: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The activity involved identifying the threat, implementing protective measures like firewall rule adjustments, and employing an IDS/IPS for continuous threat detection. Response steps were designed to contain the incident swiftly, followed by a structured recovery plan to restore normal network functionality. This project highlights my expertise in using the NIST framework to assess incident data, formulate effective mitigation strategies, and reinforce organizational resilience against future cyber threats.
