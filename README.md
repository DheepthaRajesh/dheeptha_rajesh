# 50.021-AI-Project-2024

## Project Description 
Over 1 million flats spanning across 24 towns and 3 estates, Singapore's public housing stands out as a distinct entity. These flats serve as the residence for over 80% of the country's resident population with 90% being homeowners. ​

The recent upswing in resale flat prices and the unpredictable trends in the market have underscored the necessity for accurate predictions of resale flat prices to facilitate well informed decisions. ​

The Housing Development Board (HDB), a government agency, oversees public housing in singapore and various elements, including location, flat size, flat type, remaining lease, and others, influence HDB resale flat prices. 

**How might we** develop an AI-driven solution to accurately predict resale flat prices in Singapore's public housing market, addressing the pressing need for accurate forecasts amidst market fluctuations?

This AI project adheres to all phases in the AI Project Lifecycle such as data acquisition where we gathered multiple datasets, data exploration where we visualised the relationships between different features using uni-variate and bi-variate analysis, modelling where we explored five different models - Decision tree regressor, Gradient boosting regressor, Random forest regressor, feed-forward neural networks, and ARIMA, and finally the evalutation phase where we used Root Mean Square Error as our metric and found Random Forest Regressor to perform the best. 

The project also utilises OneMap API to determine the nearest amenities such as schools, hawker centres, shopping malls and MRT stations. The streamlit library is used to develop the GUI which displays the predicted price given user input and also includes a map interface with a visual representation of the locality with the selected flat surrounded by the nearest amenities.
