Projects in this repository:

  1. **ArduinoToPython** : Transforms the data received by accelerometer in arduino to display a certain video using Python - 2022
     
  2. **AutomatedFuzzer-Testing** : An unified Python-based fuzzing tool for automated input generation and robustness testing of both high-level (Django web apps) and low-level (BLE smart lock) systems. The tool extends AFL’s grey-box fuzzing architecture to support diverse targets via a shared mutation and feedback loop. It delivers mutated inputs, observes system responses, and detects bugs or security flaws using minimal configuration. - 2025
     
  3. **BankOfAmerica-project** : Simulation of an online banking platform containing all its basic functionalities such as login/sign up, deposit, withdraw , etc. using Python - 2020
     
  4. **Cybersecurity-portfolio** : Contains cybersecurity projects from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification, including security audits, risk assessments, managing file permissions in Linux, SQL filtering for security investigations, vulnerability report for a database server, incident report analysis for DDoS attack, and an incident handler's journal for documenting security incidents, all based on real-world scenarios - 2024
     
  5. **Educational-Q&A-android(java)-app** : Android app developed using Java, Firebase and built on Stream SDK, designed to manage classroom queries while not compromising on engagement and content delivery - 2023
