# Educational Q&A Android app developed using Java

This app named Cereal is an innovative solution designed to manage classroom queries while not compromising on engagement and content delivery. Unlike existing solutions, Cereal allows peers and teaching assistants (in addition to professors) to answer questions from students, allowing them to clarify their queries without any disruption to the class and support for permission setting allows role-targeted questions to choose who your questions are targetted towards.

The app is an Android app developed using Java and built on Stream SDK and dependencies. Equipped with a robust database to handle question and reply history, these data are stored in Firebase, allowing the users to login and access their data from any device

Other features include room creation(and joining one through WebSocket connections to a cloud socket) for exclusive discussions, ability to upvote answers and the option to 'tick' answers that are satisfactory
